Project Title: Data Analytics Pipeline – From Raw Data to Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and exploring raw data in Python, to storing and querying data using SQL, to visualizing insights through a Power BI dashboard, and finally summarizing findings in a professional report and presentation (created with Gamma).
It is designed to showcase end-to-end analytics skills, including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, SQL proficiency, dashboarding, and communication of insights.

📂 Dataset

Source: Add dataset source (public dataset, company-provided, Kaggle, etc.)

Format: CSV / Excel / JSON

Description: Briefly describe what the dataset contains (e.g., sales records, customer demographics, transactions, product details).

Size: # rows, # columns

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (interactive dashboard creation)

Gamma (AI-generated presentation)

Git/GitHub (version control)

🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Import dataset into a Jupyter Notebook

Inspect schema, identify datatypes

Check for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Trends & seasonality

Correlation heatmaps

Visualization of key metrics (e.g., sales trends, customer segments)

3. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Standardizing column formats

Creating calculated/derived fields

Exporting cleaned dataset

4. SQL Integration

Load cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Write analytical queries such as:

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Joins across tables

Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)

Subqueries and CTEs

Validate insights from Python using SQL results

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connect Power BI to cleaned dataset or SQL database

Build an interactive dashboard including:

KPIs

Filters and slicers

Time-series visuals

Category & geographic analysis

Publish or export dashboard (optional)

6. Report & Presentation

Report: Detailed explanations of methodology, findings, and conclusions

Gamma Presentation:

Visual summary of the dashboard

Key insights and business recommendations

Executive-friendly storytelling
